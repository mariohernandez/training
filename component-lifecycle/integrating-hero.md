# Integrating the Hero

Now it's time to begin the integration process for the Hero component. We are going to break things down and explain each part separately.

### Exercise: Integrate the Hero

1. In your code editor, open `/src/templates/content/node--article--hero.html.twig`
2. Remove all code from the file except for comments. It is good to leave the comments untouched as they provide helpful information regarding available variables and other useful Drupal-specific details.
3. Add the following code at the bottom of the template:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="node--article--hero.html.twig" %}
```php
{% set rendered_content = content|render %}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

To follow best practices we discussed earlier regarding letting Drupal render the full content array, we are setting a twig variable for the sole purpose of triggering a full render of the content array. We are not going to use the variable at all, it is only intended to trigger Drupal to do its thing.

* Next step is to declare variables for the `title` and `cta` fields. The reason we want to do this is so we can structure these fields the same way we did when we built the components for heading and buttons in Pattern Lab.  In the example of the title field, we built in Pattern Lab with properties such as `heading_level`, `modifier`, `url`, and `title` text.  Since Drupal is only giving us the value for the `title` text property, we need to structure the remaining properties ourselves.  Although this is not required, it will make things look cleaner and more readable later on.  You'll see:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="node--article--hero.html.twig" %}
```php
{% set hero_title = {
    heading_level: '1',
    modifier: 'hero__title heading--large',
    title: label,
    url: ''
  }
%}

{% set hero_cta = {
    text: 'Get started',
    url: url,
    modifier: 'hero__cta'
  }
%}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* Reason for setting variables for the fields above is that they all have several properties in addition to the actual value of the field. Setting these variables allow us to configure all their properties and their values prior to using them.
* The variable names, `hero_title` and `hero_cta` are optional.  You can use any name that makes sense to you.
* The structure of these 2 variables matches the data structure in the components in Pattern Lab.  The biggest difference here is that for the **title** value (line 4), **text** value (line 10), and **url** value (line 11), we are passing Drupal data.
*   A good practice when getting field values is to strip white space by using the `|render|trim`Twig filters, and then check that the field is really not empty (`is not empty ?`) if that's true, we print the field's value (i.e.`content.field_title`).

    Now let's make use of the Hero component in the Paragraph template. Let's look at the code below and explain how this works.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="node--article--hero.html.twig" %}
```php
{%
  include '@storybook/hero/hero.twig' with {
    attributes: attributes,
    image: content.field_image|render|trim is not empty ? content.field_image,
    heading: hero_title,
    cta: hero_cta
  } only
%}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* We are using an `include` Twig statement to nest the Hero component into the paragraph template. Using  the  theme's namespace, `storybook`, we are able to point  Drupal to our  theme's `src/patterns/components/hero/hero.twig`  template.  As  we mentioned before, by default Drupal only looks for Twig templates inside  `src/templates/`, but thanks to the  [Component Libraries](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) module and the namespace we created, we can direct Drupal to also look for Twig templates in our components directory, among other places. \
  **IMPORTANT**:  If your theme name is not **storybook** be sure you use your theme name in the `@include` above.
* Next we pass in Drupal's `attributes` variable so that Drupal  can inject any attributes it needs to the Hero node.  This is recommended, but not required.
* The next step is to  map the `image`, `heading, and cta` fields with  Drupal's equivalent of those fields.  While creating the variables above was not required nor needed, having done so makes  the mapping of keys to their values, much cleaner.
* Notice in the `@include` statement after the twig template path there is a keyword `with`? and at the end of the block of code there is a keyword `only` ?   These are Twig's helpful keywords that make it possible to limit the fields we want to display.  For example, if we  only wanted the hero to show a title field,  we could just include that field and leave the others out.  For this to work the `with` and `only` keywords need to be present otherwise we would get errors when Drupal renders the Hero as it would expect all the other fields as well.
* Save your changes.

Once you've written all that code, the full component integration should look like this:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="paragraph--hero.html.twig" %}
```php
{# Declares variable to trigger renderign of content array #}
{% set rendered_content = content|render %}

{# Setting variable for hero title #}
{% set hero_title = {
    heading_level: '1',
    modifier: 'hero__title heading--large',
    title: label,
    url: ''
  }
%}

{% set hero_cta = {
    text: 'Get started',
    url: url,
    modifier: 'hero__cta'
  }
%}

{# Including hero component and mapping its fields to Drupal's fields #}
{%
  include '@storybook/hero/hero.twig' with {
    attributes: attributes,
    image: content.field_image|render|trim is not empty ? content.field_image,
    heading: hero_title,
    cta: hero_cta
  } only
%}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Change the field format for the button

By default Drupal is printing the button field as a single `<a>` tag. While this may work in some situations, it does not in this particular situation since we need the URL and button text values as two separate items.

1. In your Drupal site, click **Structure | Paragraph Types | Hero**
2. Click the **Manage Display** tab
3. For the **Call To Action** field, change its format to **Separate field text and URL**.
4. Save your changes.
5. Clear Drupal's cache.  Now the variable we set above will work.

### Displaying the integrated Hero in Drupal

After clearing Drupal's cache and reloading the page we should see the Hero in Drupal inheriting all the styles and markup from the component in Pattern Lab.

_**You DID IT!**_ üôå üî•

Just for fun, once the hero displays in Drupal, inspect the code again and you should see all the markup we wrote when we built the component in Pattern Lab. This means Drupal is only providing the data for the component, but the markup, styles and javascript, if any, is sourced from Pattern Lab.

## But wait ...It didn't work üëé üòù

Perhaps the Hero component is rendering properly in Drupal, and the Markup when we inspect the code all looks like it's coming from Pattern Lab. But the Hero is broken as it has no styles at all. What went wrong? The answer is Drupal Libraries. Let's fix this problem now by talking about [Drupal Libraries](drupal-libraries.md).
