# Blog articles

We'll modify Drupal core's Article content type so we can use it to generate blog post for our site. Blog articles are the content we will display on the homepage as Featured Content and From our Blog.  This means each card in the homepage represents a blog article in a compact view.  We will achieve the Card and Card Wide displays using Drupal's View Modes.
