# Drupal Views

To build the _Featured Content_ and _From our blog_ sections we are going to use the power of Drupal's views and View Modes. By querying all Article content we can generate a list of blog article posts, then using View Modes, we can determine the fields we'll expose as well as the format in which fields will be rendered. Drupal Views are database queries you can write and execute using Drupal's UI.

### Exercise: Blog articles View

Let's start by creating a new view to pull all article posts.  Then we will create two block displays out of the view; one for the **Featured Content** posts, and the other one to show the **From our Blog** posts.

1. From Drupal's Admin toolbar click **Structure | Views**
2. Click the **Add view** button
3. For View name type **Blog posts**
4. Machine name should auto complete to `blog_posts`
5. For VIEW SETTINGS, **Show** _Content_ **Of type:** _Article_
6. Check **Create a page** and set its path to **blog**
7. For PAGE DISPLAY SETTINGS, ensure **Teasers **is selected 
8. Leave **Use a pager** checkbox checked
9. Check **Create a block**
10. Under BLOCK SETTINGS be sure **Teasers** is selected
11. Type **From our blog** as the block title
12. Accept the value from the **Items per block** field
13. Click the **Save and edit** button

#### Updating the view

1. At the top of the view, change the _Display name** **_** **to **From our blog** by clicking the word **Block** and typing the new display name under the _Administrative name_ field, then pressing the **Apply** button.  This helps you distinguish each of your views displays as you work with them.  
2. In the FORMAT section, click **Settings** next to _Unformatted list_ and clear the **Add views row classes** checkbox and then press the **Apply** button.  Since we will be writing our own markup, we don't need Drupal's default classes.
3. Still in the FORMAT section, click **Content **next to **Show** and select **Thi block (override)** from the dropdown, then click **Apply this display** button.  As we discussed before, we will use the _Teaser_ view mode to display the 4 articles shown in the _From our blog** **_section.
4. Under FILTER CRITERIA, click the **Add** button, then search for **Promoted to front page** 
5. Check the checkbox next to **Promoted to front page** > _**Content**_, then click the **Add and configure filter criteria **button
6. At the filter criteria window, ensure **is equal to** is the operator, and **No** is the** **_Promoted to front page status_
7. Select **This block (override)** from the dropdown at the top of the window
8. Click_ the **Apply (this display)** button_
9. Under BLOCK SETTINGS, change the block name to **From our blog** by clicking _block, _then clicking the **Apply** button.  This will appear as the name of this block in administer >> structure >> blocks.
10. Expand the ADVANCED fieldset to the right of the view page
11. Under _Machine name**, **_click the current value and change it to **from_our_blog**, the click the **Apply** button.  Using a custom and meaningful machine name ensures our twig template suggestions will use names that make sense._** **_You will see this later.
12. In the PAGER section, click the **display all items** link and change its setting to **Display a specified number of items**, when prompted type **4** for the number of items to display.
13. _Finally, save all your changes by pressing the **Save** button.  _Failing to press_ _**Save**, will result in loosing all your changes.

Your view should look like the image below.  _Click on it to zoom in._

### Exercise: Featured Content View

Now we are going to create a new views display for the Featured Content.  We will inherit all the settings from the _From our blog_ display and then we will change things to _Featured content_.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**VERY IMPORTANT**:  On screens where you see a dropdown with the label of **for**, be sure you select **This block (override)**.  This means the changes you are making should only apply to the block/display you are currently working with, and not the original block/display we created above.
{% endhint %}

1. At the top of the new view, just below the word **Displays** click the **+ Add** button next to _From our blog_
2. Choose_ _**Block** from the dropdown
3. You will follow most of the steps from the **Updating the view** section above, but will make some modifications.
4. First, change any _From our blog _reference to **Featured content**.  Be sure the _Machine Name_ reference in step 10, is typed as follows: **featured_content**
5. For step 3 above, choose **Featured** as the view mode
6. For step 4, FILTER CRITERIA, click the existing value from _No_ to **Yes** for _Promoted to front page status_.  In addition, and **SUPER IMPORTANT**, change the **for** dropdown to **This block (override)**.  This will ensure the changes you are making don't affect the first display we built above.
7. In the middle of the view under **PAGER**, change **4 items** link and change it to **2** items to display.  Then press the **Apply**_ button.  _Be sure the **for** dropdown reads **This block (override)**.
8. Once you made all the updates, **Save** the view to conserve your changes.

The Featured Content display/block should look like this.  Click on it to zoom in.,
