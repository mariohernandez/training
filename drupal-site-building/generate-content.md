# Generate content

Since we will need blog posts to display on our homepage, let's create a few of them using the **Devel Generate** module.  This module creates all kinds of content for us using lorem ipsum text.  In addition to blog posts, we will also need to create a few user accounts and some taxonomy terms.  Let's start

### Exercise: Create Taxonomy terms and users

1. Enable the **Devel Generate** module by going to the module's page in Drupal \(Extend option from admin toolbar\)
2. Search for **Devel** and you will see **Devel Generate**.  Check the box next to it and click **Install**
3. From Drupal's admin toolbar click **Configuration &gt; Development &gt; Generate Terms**
4. Accept the defaults and click the **Generate** button
5. Repeat steps 3 & 4, but this time for **Users**

### **Generate blog posts**

1. From Drupal's admin toolbar click **Configuration &gt; Development &gt; Generate content**
2. Under **Content type** check **Blog**  then click **Generate**

We should now have plenty of blog posts to use.  Some values in our content may be need to be tweaked as some content may be too long for our purpose.

### Promote blog posts to homepage

Pick two blog posts, edit them and choose **Promote to the frontpage** from the **Promotion Options** tag in the node edit page.
