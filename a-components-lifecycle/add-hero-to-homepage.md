# Add Hero to homepage

Now that we have a view mode display ready to go, let create a new node of type Homepage so we can add the hero of our choice.

### Exercise: Create the homepage node with a hero

1. From Drupal's admin toolbar, click **Content \| Add content**
2. Select **Homepage** as the type of content to create
3. Under title type **Homepage**
4. In the Hero field, begin typing to search for the article you wish to turn into the Hero
5. When the targeted article is found, select it and click the **Save** button
6. The homepage node will now rendered and we should see a large image and a title

The Hero is now displaying in Drupal using the designated view mode display.  We will handle the styles of the hero in a later exercise.
