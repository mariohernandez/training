# Featured Content

So far we've been building individual components and built them in a way we can re-use them. Well, the time has come to build a list of content where we will re-use most components we've built. This is where component-based shines. By looking at the design comp below, we can see that we will be showing a collection of cards. In addition, the section has a title of "Featured Content" .

![Featured Content List](../.gitbook/assets/featured-content.jpg)

## Component data

1. Inside `src/patterns/components`create a new folder called **featured-content**
2. Inside the _featured-content_ folder create a new file called `featured-content.json`
3. Inside _featured-content.json_ add the following code:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="featured-content.json" %}
```yaml
{
  "heading": {
    "heading_level": "2",
    "modifier": "heading--large center section-header",
    "title": "Featured Content",
    "url": ""
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "image": "<img src='https://source.unsplash.com/EwKXn5CapA4/400x520' alt='alt text here' />",
      "heading": {
        "heading_level": "3",
        "modifier": "card__title",
        "title": "The beauty of nature",
        "url": "#"
      },
      "date": "Jun 25",
      "category": "Sports",
      "body_text": "Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper. Vivamus sgittis lacus vel augue laoreet.",
      "author": {
        "photo": "<img src='https://source.unsplash.com/_cvwXhGqG-o/100x100' alt='Author's headshot' />",
        "name": "Valentina De Leon",
        "title": "Digital Strategist"
      },
      "modifier": "card--wide"
    },
    {
      "image": "<img src='https://source.unsplash.com//a8lTjWJJgLA/400x520' alt='Tech gadgets' />",
      "heading": {
        "heading_level": "3",
        "modifier": "card__title",
        "title": "The beauty of nature",
        "url": "#"
      },
      "date": "Sep 27",
      "category": "Lifestyle",
      "body_text": "Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper. Vivamus sgittis lacus vel augue laoreet.",
      "author": {
        "photo": "<img src='https://source.unsplash.com/_cvwXhGqG-o/100x100' alt='Author's headshot' />",
        "name": "Valentina De Leon",
        "title": "Digital Strategist"
      },
      "modifier": "card--wide"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

There is a lot going on in this file. Let's go over it and you will see that it's actually relatively straight forward.

* First we defined the `heading`  object which will be used as the title for the entire collection.
* At around line 8, we declared an `items` array.  This will help us mimic the array of content to build the collection.
* Each item in the items array represents a card.  Inside each card item we have defined the card's fields (`image`, `title`, `body_text`, `cta` ).  We have repeated this 3 times to achieve the collection shown in the Featured Content image above.

### Component markup

So the data is ready, let's go ahead and add the markup for the component.

1. Inside the _featured-content_ folder create a new file called `featured-content.twig`
2. Inside _featured-content.twig_ add the following code:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="featured-content.twig" %}
```php
{{ attach_library('storybook/featured-content') }}

<section class="featured-content{{ modifier ? ' ' ~ modifier }}{{- attributes ? ' ' ~ attributes.class -}}"
  {{- attributes ? attributes|without(class) -}}>
  {% if heading %}
    {%
      include '@storybook/heading/heading.twig' with {
        "heading": heading
      } only
    %}
  {% endif %}

  <div class="featured-content__items">
    {% block featured_items %}
      {% for item in items %}
        {%
          include '@storybook/card/card.twig' with {
            "image": item.image,
            "heading": item.heading,
            "date": item.date,
            "category": item.category,
            "body_text": item.body_text,
            "author": item.author,
            "modifier": item.modifier
          } only
        %}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endblock featured_items %}
  </div>
</section>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Component styles

1. Inside the _hero_ folder create a new file called **featured-content.scss**
2. Inside `featured-content.scss` add this code:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="featured-content.scss" %}
```css
// Import site utilities
@import '../../global/utils/init';

.featured-content {
  @include component-spacing;
  background-color: $color-gray-light;
  padding: 40px 20px 0;

  @include breakpoint($bp-md) {
    padding-bottom: 100px;
  }
}

// On mobile cards are displayed
// vertically as a group.
.featured-content__items {
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

  // On larger screens cards are displayed
  // horizontally as a group.
  @media screen and (min-width: $bp-lg) {
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-around;
  }

  .card {
    margin-bottom: 60px;

    @media screen and (min-width: $bp-xl) {
      flex: 0 0 45%;
      margin-bottom: 0;
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Don't forget to create the library.

### Compiling the code to generate the Featured Content

While in your theme's root directory, run the following commands in your command line and press **Return**

`npm run build`

`npm run watch`

{% hint style="info" %}
**TIP:** Since we created a whole new component; if you had the watch task running, it is recommended you stop it by pressing **Ctrl + C** on your keyboard and run the commands above. This will ensure the new component will be generated and all related code will be compiled.
{% endhint %}

In your browser of choice open the following URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This will open Pattern Lab where you can find the Hero component under components.

Next, we are going to build the back-end infrastructure in Drupal for this collection. This also will be a unique approach compared to previous components we've built in Drupal.
