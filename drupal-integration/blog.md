# Blog detail page

Although not part of our design, but just for fun, let's clean up the full/detail page for blog posts.  This is the page you see when you click any of the blog posts titles from the homepage.

Some of the things we need to do include:

1. Create a hero image from the uploaded image to the blog post
2. Create image styles for the hero image
3. Style the author information and tags
4. Clean up the overall look of the page
